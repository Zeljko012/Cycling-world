            <h1>Did you know?</h1> <br><br>
            
            <p>That more than 100 million bicycles are manufactured each year? And that there are over 1 billion bicycles that are currently being used and ridden all around the world? Looking at these statistics, there’s no wonder why cycling is one of the best and most preferred pastimes for people who wish to reduce the risk of strokes and heart diseases.<br><br>

                But did you ever wonder how bicycles really came into existence? Or how the two-wheeler vehicle with pedals, handlebars, and a saddle-like seat that you ride today acquired these particular features and characteristics?<br><br>
                
                Bicycles have quite a varied history that goes back about more than 600 years, during which the bicycle was extremely different than the one you know of today. They have significantly evolved over time with major innovations that dramatically transformed all of its form and features.<br><br>
                
                Back in the days, bicycles did have two wheels like we do today, however; earlier models didn’t have pedals or steering. Imagine riding a bicycle without pedals – crazy, isn’t it?

            <h2>Evolution of The Bicycle</h2>
            <p>A highly interesting fallacy in the bicycle history is that Leonardo Da Vinci sketched a few bicycle designs during the 1940’s that sported a very modern and contemporary look and form. The sketches were said to have been discovered in the 16th century however, many historians claim that those designs were never transformed into working models, hence deeming the existence of the sketches untrue.<br><br>

                Another erroneous belief that sprung up in ancient times was that the first ever bicycle was invented during the 1860’s by Pierre and Ernest Michaux, the French father and son duo who were basically carriage-makers. While they did invent a bicycle with rotary cranks and pedal in 1861, there is no evidence that they were the first ones to make the first ever bike with pedals.<br><br>
                
                So who really did invent the first bicycle?<br><br>
                
                The very first practical and verifiable bicycle is believed to have been invented by a German man called Baron Karl von Drais in 1817. He named this bicycle “Laufmaschine” or “The Running Machine” since it consisted of two wheels held together with the help of a single central bar. It was a balance bike made out of wood and consisted of a lever to help steer the front wheels, instead of pedals. during its first ride, the bicycle was reported to have covered 13 kilometers in less than an hour, which was considered super impressive for a machine that weighed almost 22 kilograms.<br><br></p>
