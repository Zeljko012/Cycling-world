            <p>Cyclocross bikes are primarily designed to be raced around a dirt trail that consists of different obstacles and blockages placed at various intervals. The purpose behind those barriers is that the rider or cyclist has to dismount mid-cycling and carry the bicycle for different short periods of time.<br><br>

                These bikes are super lightweight but also tough and sturdy enough to deal with intense conditions of cyclocross racing, which may often, involve cyclists taking laps around courses on pavements, grass and dirt trails. Most cyclocross bikes come with semi-knobby tires to ensure that the bike can handle any given terrain challenges.</p>
