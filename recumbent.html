            <p>This type of bicycle is more popular as a “non-traditional” bicycle because it requires one to sit in a seat that is lower to the ground and looks like a chair. Recumbent bikes consist of different configurations including long to short wheelbases, varieties of two, three or four wheelers, as well as under and above seat steering.<br><br>

                These bikes allow for a function similar to doing a seated leg press whereby the cyclist is required to properly rest against the backrest of the bicycle in order to help them turn a larger gear. A defining feature of recumbent bikes often deemed as a drawback is that one cannot stand up while pedaling up a challenging hill because of its form and design.</p>
