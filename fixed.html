            <p>Often referred to as “fixies”, Fixed Gear or Track bikes are primarily used for racers and athletes that are training for professional races. The main reason for this is that as the name aptly suggests, these bikes contain a single, fixed gear, which means that you cannot coast or freewheel on this type of bike. This suggests that cyclists or riders using this bike have to make use of their leg strength in order to stop the cranks of the bike from turning, and further halting its motion.<br><br>

                Fixed gear bikes may contain several brakes and varied styles of handlebars and they usually require cyclists to spin their legs in constant circles in order to run a higher cadence.</p>
