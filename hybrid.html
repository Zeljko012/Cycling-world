            <p>Hybrid bikes are best described as a mix of road, mountain and touring bike designs, making them more of “do-it-all” kind of bikes that cater to a wide range of uses. These bikes usually sport a combination of large road bike sized wheels that make them work amazingly well on both paved trails and smooth dirt. They also feature a flat bar and a heads-up ride to ensure better view and comfort while riding. They may often contain disc brakes for responsive and impressive braking, especially when riding in turbulent weather conditions.<br><br>

                Many hybrid bikes that are considered as commuter-friendly models include fenders, racks and lighting systems. However, it is important to note that no two hybrid bikes are entirely same so you must choose one according to your requirements and the type of riding you plan on doing.</p>
