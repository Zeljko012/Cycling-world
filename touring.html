            <p>These are almost like the traditional road bikes, except with a few tweaks and changes that make them perfect for long-distance bike tours. Touring bikes come with multiple attachment points with the help of which you can attach fenders, pumps, lights, racks, water bottles and so much more. They also contain super sturdy frames that allow them to carry heavy loads on both the front and the rear racks.<br><br>

                You must have noticed that in many touring bikes come with a longer wheelbase, which is specially engineered to provide more control to the rider, owing to their lower center of gravity. Majority of touring bikes also consist of disc brakes that provide them with enhanced stopping power, particularly on non-paved surfaces. A defining feature of touring bikes is their wide or semi-knobby tires that are especially designed to handle gravel roads.</p>
