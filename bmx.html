            <p>BMX is an acronym for Bicycle Motor Cross, primarily because this type of bicycle is a single-speed bike that is raced around short dirt tracks, quite similar in nature to the motor sport. The acronym is also often used describe any bike with single-speed and a 20-inch wheel.<br><br>

                BMX bikes are ideal for people who intend to perform tricks and jumps with their bikes because they are especially built for that, with their robust and durable design and structure. They consist of small frames, a single gear and twenty inch wheels which means that they are not only strong but very low maintenance too as compared to an average bicycle.</p>
