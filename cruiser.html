            <p>Cruiser bikes come under the umbrella term of “specialty bikes” that contain very specific end uses and features, setting them apart from other types of bikes.  Cruiser bikes are meant for leisurely rides that one would take around the town and their neighborhood.<br><br>

                Most of these bikes feature wider 26-inch tires as compared to several other pavement bikes. They consist of comfortable seats that allow for relaxed seating positions, and often also internally geared rear hubs that allow easy and convenient maintenance.</p>
