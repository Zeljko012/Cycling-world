            <p>Folding bikes are believed to be excellent travel companions. As the name suggests, they fold super easily and smoothly, allowing them to be able to effortlessly fit on a boat, in the trunk of a car or on a subway. They can even be folded and carried in a carrying bag which makes them extremely convenient for commuters who have limited storage space at home or elsewhere.<br><br>

                A few overriding features of folding bikes include smaller wheels, with most of them being 20-inches, making it easy for the bike  to get over bumps and potholes in order to provide you with a smooth ride. Another great feature is that they have adjustable functions on the folding frame, handlebar and saddle, all which allow an easier folding process. Many also have adjustable latches that help the bike collapse easily.</p>
